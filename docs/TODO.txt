TODO
====

* Add coverage for making sure that the htmlhead viewlet doesn't
  disable the border (optilude)

* Add coverage to sort.txt for topics without sort criteria

  Make sure both grouped.pt and batch_macros work when no sort
  criteria have been added. (optilude)

* Add coverage for integer range criteria (SimO)

  "...i.e: I set a range 0:100 and it shows me 5 items. If I put in
  the portlet a second value of 80, instead of showing me 4 items it
  shows NO items and worst, even if a re-insert 100 in the second
  value nothing happens and I have to reload the page to get my
  items. The weird thing is that if I set 0:80 trough the criteria tab
  it works fine and it shows me 4 items."

* Ensure that only formFields are taken from the request

* Form sort criteria

* Add single selection (pulldown, radio) criteria (davisagli)

* Fix folder_contents view to support deleting, etc.

* Use subcollections to support AdvancedQuery operations

  Collections will act as grouping/parenthesis *and* operators.  IOW,
  a collection will have a boolean field to set whether it uses AND or
  OR to find the intersection or union of its result sets.
  Sub-collections will not acquire criteria but instead parent
  collections will treat sub-collections as criteria groupings.  Not
  yet sure how to handle sorting.
